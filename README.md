# React Native + Nativewind

This is a template containing all the setup performed to get Expo + Nativewind working.
I intend to use this for my react native projects but incase you wish to use, please clone and change the app name to your desired value in [app.json](./app.json)

## Start Command

```bash
npm i
npx expo start -c
```

For more information please refer to [Expo](https://expo.dev/)
